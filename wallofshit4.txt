To be honest I came to the moors the very first time it opened and was ganked immediately at the little camp fire outside of GV. I did not come back for a while. Now that I have been out here for a while I love PvP. I don't care about the gear, pots or anything else I like the unexpected nature of the environment and I have always liked the aspect of leveling even if it does not give me any extra traits, weapons, armour etc.

If you mean sometime either May or June of 07, it was probably Finese and Discodanny. haven't seen them since summer of 07.

You just gotta find a way to avoid them or fight back

HOGG - Destroyed in PvP for less than 10 silver.

It's very simple.

craft a lvl 60 armor suit with size 2 gems

pack your suit full of unholy and holy resistance.

Yellow Sacrosanct Cabochon Gems

Black Unhallowed Cabochon Gems

gems for this cost less between 1tin to 1 silver a piece so your entire suit will maybe cost you 10 silver in gems, plus resources to craft the low level suit. Keep suit handy for any time you travel through field of the dead just for the fun of attacking them.

they can't touch you.

Hogg isn't great at PvP.

Like 10 minutes ago Nono decides to jump me in the Armsmans Tavern, apparently he had his friends hiding, in case he is about to lose. (Which I am sure they are used to by now at 80 PvP)

Soon as I get Puppets off and get him under 20% health they pop out of hide and 3v1 me.

SKILL imo, maybe they all need to reroll PvE and actually try to be good at something.

OOC chat is full of hate for HoGG, saying that all they do is killing lowbies, which is partially true, but they still kill lots of group of 80s.

By the way, you don't get to HOGG by zerging them with more than double their numbers. I got some very nice hate tells from them in East Ruins when our Demo/DT/PoM rolled their Necro/Necro/PoM group. They promptly called for ranger back-up and accused the hidden lowbie Ranger we had of using "radar." Damn, they figured us out, we have a Ranger that uses tracking. HOGG couldn't beat our 3 man team with their 3 main team, so they had to call for reinforcements. They like ganking lowbie's, they don't mind getting killed by groups much larger than theirs, but beat them in an even number fight and they go ape ****.

I was pretty impressed when I fought Hogg on that bridge. In my mind thats a pre-organized strategy which means they are moving from small time griefers to a tight group of aware pvpers that show foresight and the ability to utilise the servers perception of them to dictate terms and terrain. I mean what other guild would be able to drag whole groups of 80's out into FotD to pvp. None. And that we are willing to continue to try and take them down even with their obvious advantage.

I find fighting Hogg these days to be great pvp practice and experience for all involved and a great place to try new strategies in group pvp. I mean lets face it, at least they are still around to provide some competition. I'd recommend it to anyone who is able to let Hogg's extravagent attitude to OOC not phase them.

Thanks for sticking around Hogg and teaching us new aspects of pvp we wouldn't just get at your everyday khesh romp.

The only 2 times they "tried" rez camping me in Kesh, I was able to stun... repulse... walk off the rez pad while laughing to myself. Sure they gave chase for a little bit, but the good thing about a decent size guild is that you can easily camp both rez points in the zone until they are forced to path out. That's why you don't see them in Kesh, they just can't grief as effectively and most other zones have more rez pads so they can go somewhere else. I have ran into HOGG maybe 6 times and NEVER even came close to dying.

I do have a serious question though... What is the purpose of your guild? I don't get it. I understand just wanting to grief people, but is it fun? It just seems like a waste of $15/month and it seems to me that pulling the wings off of butterflies or burning the legs off of ants would give you the same pleasure, so why pay for it? There is very little to do right now in the game, but you're not even utilizing the little content that was put into the game. Why not instead go to WoW or another MMO with more people so you can grief more people?

Why do I get a feeling that I'm going to get a ridiculous response to my questions?

Funny thing, I was in Atzel's Aproach day before yesterday and HOGG was camping the Northern rez point with six lvl 75+ toons. In fact it was all the ones that are running their traps on here. I didnt mind the PVP at first. Im a 65 ranger and got PK'd by them of course but then for 30min they sat at the rez point and killed all the respawns. I got to the point of just putting walk on and meandering through a whole 15m from the point and dying over and over. Not sure what they were hoping for. It had to get pretty boring to smoke the same 4 toons over and over. And I think I was the highest level of the 4. They must have nothing else to do or thought that smoking 15% health toon 10 levels under was a big accomplishment. If thats the case then put a video out of all your PKing. Im sure everyone would be so impressed and you can feel better about yourself.

You guys at HOGG actually redefine the concept of failure. When you created your guild that word was destroyed and recreated anew with a definition consisting only of a two minute .avi of your in-game adventures.

You actually managed to complete the Trifecta of Terrible by being: poorly trained, poorly equipped, and still poorly leveled. That is unheard in online video games. Somehow, someway... while even ameoba eventually actually learn from outside stimuli... you guys actually resist improvement.

In fact, by accident most people would have stumbled into a modicum of success by hitting the wrong button or even playing while raging drunk. Unfortunately for you guys you literally can't even fail correctly. It is seriously a case worthy of scientific study.

This cop-out story that you have somehow chosen to fight low level people is laughable. Let's be honest. You don't have a choice because you can't fight anywhere else. You don't have to lie to kick it. We won't throw you out of the game for at least owning up to yourself.

No one believes you only fight level 80s. How on earth your brain can handle the cognitive dissonance of creating a thread about "griefing" while then claiming to only kill level 80 people... it is truly jackassery of such a degree we'll need the next five pages of this thread just to create a new word to describe how it is your brain works. Or doesn't work as the case may be.

Dude. Without anyone else talking. You somehow managed to destroy whatever asinine point it was you were eventually going to approach. That means if we were to take out every human being in the rest of the world, and probably most of the higher level primates, and we were to let you begin a debate with whatever was left... you would have already lost to yourself midway through the first paragraph.

The very thought of you makes me wonder why we bother with global warming. I think mass drowning may be the only way to fix this kind of thing.

When I have witnessed any HOGG in PvP with another 80 or similar high lvl you die or run. You have only proven that you can kill 7 noobs for every time that they or their guild has shown up to give an even lvl fight and not been able to run/zone or whatever other cowardly tactic you found to avoid real PvP.

You have cleverly chosen to define "success" as anything but being successful in this game. Lets analyze:

Success Is:

(1)We succeed when people get griefed enough to call their guildies.

So you succeed when someone asks their guild for reinforcements. Let's you and I wonder why someone has a guild on a PvP server, shall we? A group of players that play together... what could that be useful for? Could it be.. and this is a theory here... that people have guilds to try and fight the other people in this game that have already grouped up to fight together? Could they in fact be calling a guild to stop the guild that - and this point may take some time to grasp so read it again, I can wait - already called out its other members to kill the intended victim? Breath and take it in. Already, the people you are killing, by your definition, are raging successes at this game. Somehow they actually managed to be a success without killing a single person, just by you calling your guild to fight in their zone. Ok. So by definition one you succeed with slightly more work than the level 20 guy you just killed.

(2)We succeed when people get angry enough to follow us around in safe zones. Ok. So you attack people. They attack you back. You run and they don't remain stationary. What do you do when you attack a guy and he runs? I don't follow HOGG around a lot so you can fill that in like a MadLib but in your head. Do you in fact follow them when they run? So, any time anyone doesn't stand still they succeed. Hey, sure dude works for me. People that move to avoid death are raging beacons of success.

(3)We succeed when people cry out in OOC chat and ask where HOGG is. When people ask where you are - you become a winner? Somehow any inquiry into your location is now the criteria for victory? Do the people win if they guess the correct zone? I'm not sure how that works. Is it a guessing game? You exist and if you are lucky enough for anyone else on Earth to care you get a prize? Sure, why not.

(4)We succeed every time we get a /tell because of our actions. So if someone talks to you, and they happen to be talking to you about you, you are now the champion? Are their more criteria? What if they are trying to explain to you why you just died to them? Did you win the duel because they PM'd you with advice? Does that me every time you respond they are now the winner? Every time you talk to someone are you bestowing victory on them? Sexy. Wait a minute... is this some sort of trick to get us to talk to you in game? Dude, all you had to do was come correct. ASL?

(5)We succeed when people write an essay about how we suck and post it on the forums. To be honest I can't argue with that. One would have to suck a lot, a massive amount really, for another person to take the time out of their life to post an essay about it on a gaming forum. That kind of sucking is probably worthy of some sort of prize. You win. You suck enough for people to write about it.

Sorry I don't have any sort of cool ribbon or trophy or anything. I was so cynical I didn't actually think you'd win this one - caught me by surprise here are the end. Crap. You succeeded.

Zerr and I fought around 6 or so times on day in Bubshur, I am 80, a demo havok, with limited gems, he was I think 76. I lost 5 out of 6 times I think. He played a necro and did very very well against all I could throw at him.

Admittedly, when you look at the giants of pvp on our server, I am near the bottom of the list. I normally dont fight anyone unless attacked. So its a forgone conclusion that my initial stratagy is bad from a pvp point of view.

Frankly, I am done with pvp. It has nothing in it that attracts me, from the utter inanity of OOC to the mass griefing of newbies, I honestly wish I had moved on my own to a PVE server, to save myself an untold amount of bullshit.

As anti-supportive as Hogg is to newbies, I cant say they never fought anyone level 80. It is my first and last character to reach 80 on Tyranny.

"The psychopath is defined by a continual seeking of psychological gratification in criminal, sexual, or aggressive impulses and the inability to learn from past mistakes. Using Freudian terminology, the psychopathic personality occurs when the ego can't mediate between the id and the super-ego, thus allowing the id to run off the pleasure principle, and the super-ego has no control over the actions of the ego. In other words, individuals with this disorder gain satisfaction through their antisocial behavior as well as lack a conscience."

Only time they got my 80 is when there was 5v1 =( Can't win if you can't move and being tracked =/

No biggie, all in good fun...btw...it normally only takes one-shot to kill these guys. Mez, Heartseeker...dead HOGG...

This message was intended for individuals who wish to walk through FoTD solo and be able to take a mob of 5 hogg casters at once without being hurt too badly. It's true, was tested last night with a lvl1 gemmed suit... resistance was immaculate, now multiply the resistance with a gem size 2 suit, and attacks are futile.

No its not that they dont think they are omni ... they think they are the 4th option. Their rules are to never buff anyone outside their guild or help anyone else omni neut or clan in anyway but to take full advantage of others every chance they get. I think back in 2001 most all my guild made there hates lists not sure why since IC never did anything to any of them.

In any case lets all treat them the same way no outside buffs ... teams .... or allowed in raids. Let them be a 4th option im all for that. The funny thing is they cant even raid easy stuff one of them paid 70 mill per Dust Brigade Notum Infuser in my shop. Think they took 4 of them .... hehe Thanks Hogg I kinda was just storing them in my shop I didnt think anyone would be that helpless to accually pay that much for them.

I dont care if you want to act like you dont even know how I am .... Inner Circle has had a long history with you fools over the years. Always been a laughable subject and I can see you still are. So keep it up .... after no one will join or help or let you hang out just like back then. You will just slowly disapear for another few years like you always do.

Omni don't like Clan, because Omni get pwned by Clan. But Clan also pwn HOGG:

HOGG that just want to grief on everything. Omni may think they can deal with HOGG

their way. But the only thing that can pwn a HOGG is a Clam, with some dsharks. The problem with Clan is: they pwn too much or pwn when it isn't appropriate - and it takes an Omni to show them that. But sometimes, Omni can be so full of grief that they become HOGG themselves... because Omni are an inch and half away from HOGG. I don't know much about this crazy, crazy world, but I do know this: If you don't let us pwn these HOGGs, we're going to have our Clan and Omni all covered in grief!

They spent about 45 minutes killing me at a resurrection spot, cause they are too scared to fight anybody their own level. I guess one shotting me gives their fingers some good practice for other battles with 50s and 60s. Great job guys keep up the good work upholding your guilds name.

Notice the Tyranny guys have accepted the HOGG clan for what it is. An unabashed griefer guild that DOES NOT CARE what anyone says or feels about them.

If you see the HOGG tag I suggest either run away as fast as you can or to not hesitate and attack as hard as you can regardless of the odds. I doubt you will get a tell back of "fag" or other BS if you do kill one of them. My advice though is to camp them until they get backup in, then bail.

Now now gentlemen, I would suggest you get your ducks in a row before you start saying those things.

HOGG can be the most annoying tards on the server, we all know, atleast the ones that have been with Tyranny since day one. Of course they do not have a large scale of 80s for they like to do their griefing on a more personal level. The key part of this reply is to say yes they are annoying and yes they seem quite childish, BUT they are skilled in their craft.

Bring a even field agianst the majority they will roll you. Most have to bring raids out to take them down. Not many can walk around in Pict armor and make jokes of half the server. I by no means a lover of their actions, but the facts are facts.

Now don't get me wrong in thinking that i'm saying you lack the ability, just saying give it a try before you say we gunna getcha. Even though they have appeared to be a bit weaker without gems raging like cancer lately, wuzup HOGG?

HOGG Guild doing lame on Tyranny - and look what FUNCOM's GM say

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two guys from HOGG guild got they low lvls and head to Keshatta.

They waited for the guilds start fight (all 80s) and then they jumped into the fight to get killed by aoe's, dot, etc.****

Yesterday, at least 4 guilds (Illuminati, Addiction, Insurrection, Reincarnation, DawnRazors if Im not wrong) got murder point because of that.

After everybody got murder status, they move to murder camp and start spam on /ooc how happy they are because everybody was on that situation (earning murder points).

The sad thing its not about that guild. Yes, they are idiots. But Im really sad about Funcom.

I did open a petition, but no GM show up to see. They did that for hours and no GM show up. I kept saying to the GM: come here just to ready the ooc channel please! And nothing...

I will post one screenshot later proving the chat bellow.

After 8 minutes with no answer i sent this: Are you there man ?

GM: Yes.

few seconds later GM: Adios

I answer: what????

GM: your petition is close.

PS: I will post the ss later, from home.

Even If I was wrong, say "ADIOS" without any explanation for a paying customer, it's not professional.

After few more try, a friend finally got a GM that got all our names, and committed to investigate the case. Lets see what will happen when I log in again, but for some reason, I did not believe on him.

Anyway, that "free buff kill", dont remember the exactly name, is it working for low lvls that go to Keshatta?

If it's not, we will be force to do 1000 redeemer quests, just because funcom cant make these things works?

Believe me guys, its was a massive fights, all guild have many players. Was really really hard to see the f. retards coming. Sometimes they just got a dot and we stop the attack very fast, but a few seconds later, another guild kill him with some AOE and ban, we earn more 20 murder points.

You can say that we all should log off, but come on, ask for more then 30 players log off or just stand there and not fight because 2 stupid players its not reasonable, we are not paying for this.

And I won't even start complain about how funcom did a great job making many players on Tyranny server get pvp lvl 4 on few days. but "adios"???!?

I do really like this game, but its been really hard stay here...

As far as HOGG goes, i've never liked them for their morals, but I give them loads of credit for using the terrain to their advantage. They understand that a clothy can't go toe to toe with a Tank, so they run & shoot, duck & hide, DPS then heal. Overall I think they are doing great at PVP by understanding the game mechanics and using them as they were intended.

At least HOGG was rolling non rogue characters, and you generally knew where they'd be if you were (1) aware of your surroundings and (2) paying any attention to OOC chat. I never saw them run from even or mismatched fights until I saw them outnumbered by 3:1 getting chased through FotD one night.

Excuse the ignorance...but what is this

HOGG

business?

Just another random well geared PKer griefing or what?They are a group of people who went out and spent dough on gearing up their characters from the cash shop, and now they like to go into low-level areas and grief the low-level players constantly.

I think that they are griefing under RoM's definition of griefing, and that they are spamming chat, and should be warned to stop. (At the very least the spamming chat everytime they kill someone.)

For the lower-level players, this is turning into a serious problem, as it is greatly annoying for the only high-level players in a low-level area to be killing lowbies. Gives a bad impression of higher-level characters, people think, well if this is the only thing to do once I reach 35+, then why should I keep playing?

I really wish the GMs would do something about these obvious griefers. I think one of them got banned for selling stuff for real money, but following people around and constantly killing them, without entering a war, is clearly griefing under the rules and should be dealt with accordingly. Spamming chat with announcements about killing people is exceptionally annoying, and is also against the rules. (It gets really bad if you have 4 or 5 of them traveling together, because then all 5 of them have to say who they killed.)

@OP: You do realize, that despite your smug satisfaction at having avoided them, that 1. They really aren't a threat to high-level players, 2. They will eventually move to Indigo as well? and 3. No one in the higher-level guilds takes them as a serious threat? They fail so bad at actual skills, that the only way they can kill people is if they are 5-10 levels below them, or if they outnumber them 3 to 1.

So we won't be seeing grimdal's favorite griefer guild (HOGG) for a couple days (according to their website) and it made me think about a few things. Does RoM frown upon PvP on grimdal? It seems like RoM is starting to hurt population-wise. I've noticed a big drop in population since i started but only now after so many weeks RoM takes action against said guild? Why not sooner? All hogg was doing was PvPing, and it makes me reluctant to continue leveling if I could punished simply for killing other players. A lot of people get spammed in /say when they get "griefed" by these players but with blacklist option clearly renders this spam obsolete, which leads me to believe that serious PvP (which very few people actually do on this server) can be punishable. I mean seriously outside of a couple people I never see anyone attacking anyone else on this game. Is it because they already know that PvP is punishable? Is there something I dont know about pvp servers???? someone please tell me whats going on here

Enjoy your 3 days without HOGG. Im going to make an alt now that I know I wont be killed 37 times in Silverspring. ROM should just terminate these guys because all they do is pvp non-stop for 12 hour periods.

then thats taking the fun out of an open PVP server dont you think? people PVP in an open pvp server so they have the option of ganking and killing in a bad manner, to play the role of a villain (mmoRPG DUR?)

if all people want is normal DUELS (which is laughable) just roll on PVE where they can go say "rdy?" everytime they start dueling

besides just kill HOGG back by forming your own group or something? and if you cant win, it really means they are better

LOL yes its clear by now that HOGG was not punished for any kind of chat actions. People spam in zone chat every time they kill HOGG and do they ever get banned? No. I see people spamming stupid things like "duck duck goose xxxx is it!!" in chat a thousand times per day and do they get banned? No. I see people using the most vulgar terms ive ever seen in zone chat against HOGG, do they get banned? Nope. So what was the only other thing HOGG was doing besides chat spam? Raping the souls out of every single player between Logar and Obsidian stronghold. So which seems more believable, banned for easily-blacklistable chat or worldwide-soulrapage?

HOGG is systematically destroying a F2P game I can't believe how Insane this guild of 4-5 players is at Grief. Everything in zone chat is HOGG this and that and when they kill someone they post it in zone chat EVERY SINGLE TIME "Louie was just GRIEFED by HOGG". Its getting old Im moving to Indigo. Dont join Grimdal HOGG has destroyed it.

These people are very sad individuals, who have little else to do with their lives except grief, and they claim to be doing it because everyone else leads a sad life for playing mmo games. They may eventually realise that life is for living and grow up.

What's funny though is that they tried to grief in Darkfall online at release, and got absolutely obliterated, so they left with their tails wagging between there legs. Not wanting to endorse Darkfall, but the game proved that the Hogg guys can't really do anything outside generic point and click mmo's, because they aren't good skill based fps players. Whats funny is that before Darkfall came out they made loads of You Tube threads saying they would destroy the game and its server in 2 months after launch, but they just got pawned every time they tried to grief, so hence they have moved back to easy games which they know they can exploit, e.g. point & click theme park mmo's. Not having a pop at point & click theme park, as I play them as well.

My advice, just ignore Hogg if you get griefed, log out or escape, they can only be in one place at one time. Yes they claim they will wait 6 hours for you to log back in, but again people can only wait for so long before they get bored. Make another character and come back a day later, I doubt they'll be their despite what they claim. They are poor players who hunt in packs on individual low lvlers to get their kicks, nothing more.

Personally I have never encountered them, but I witnessed what happened to them in Darkfall.

Hogg sucked on Tyranny, they resorted to camping field of the dead lowbies with their max level chars and when 80's would show up they would die and disappear. The do fill a purpose in the MMO genre though. Everyone needs a bad guy.

HOGG never played Darkfall man if they had it would have been bad. They made fun of anyone that bought and played Darkfall you should listen to their HOGG Radio about it. You said you never witnessed them in action and I believe that because its something rediculous to see. I also played on Tyranny and it was really bad which their fraps shows. I watched them kill all kinds of great guilds on AOC and now ROM its really bad man. People always start off saying how they cant kill anyone their levels etc and they kill everyone.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A guild that has a stated goal that is directly contrary to the rules should be banned on sight. HOGG's stated goal is to annoy other players, and they direct all their efforts to this end, clearly against the rules. Even though Grimdal is a PvP server, it does not give HOGG the license to go around and kill the same people over and over again. I personally think that taking your level 50+ toon into Logar and Silverspring and killing anyone there, when there is no benefit at all to your character, is just being an ass, and should also be considered griefing.

All that said, HOGG was not banned for PvPing, they were banned for PvPing and being a bunch of asses about it. Their stated goal on their site is to go into a game and grief everyone until they are banned. The fact that the RoM devs finally wised up to it is not a sign that the server is dying, it is a sign that the GMs are finally paying attention to the tons of reports about HOGGs being a-holes and racists.

Every-time they killed someone, regardless if it was 5 of them in the same area who all killed the same person, all 5 of them felt the need to tell the zone that they had just griefed someone. This is obvious spamming, especially when they are in a lower-level area, and no one has a chance against them. So all you see is **** was just griefed by HOGG. This is known as spamming zone chat, and thank god that rule was finally enforced.

On the Grimdal server, the only thing that hogg means to us is a small group of players that do nothing but PK. They are in a guild called Hogg and have names like blablahogg. Generally they are PKing lower level people. I have heard stories that several of them were temporarily banned on our server. Not really sure, I saw one yesterday in Harf Tradding post in the door way at the house NPC attacking any lvl 30 that ran by. Than when he got attacked he ran inside his house.

Grimdal has been falling on it's own sword for months. Fact is more players have left and are leaving from unresolved pvp issues and changes that have been made as opposed to recent changes and the actions of just a couple people here recently. I don't really care to see HOGG get banned for doing what has been allowed. Just as I didn't care for the bannings in August for actions that were after the fact deemed punishable. Bold and improper moves in my opinion that have left the server feeling more hurt than helped as it has vastly affected the ingame economy as everyone of these players were big CS users.

Thorzan repeatedly referred to people as N----r. After many people having sent in various screenshots, most of us that were offended by it, just put him on the blacklist. So it would be more accurate to say that Thorzan used racist language, so far as I know, no other HOGG did.

Yes, of course, because I put my character's hp in my signature, I obviously must be dumb. Logic fail, but then, it doesn't surprise me that a HOGG doesn't know how to use logic.

Whenever I ask for a FA run, I am invited within 10 seconds to a party, (on my alt, who is only level 24). You're a HOGG, so you don't do FA, thus your opinion regarding it is moot. If you ever asked for a party, no one would want you, because your entire clan is a bunch of griefers.

To be honest, since you are a HOGG, I really don't give a crap what you think, because a lot of what comes out your mouth is just a pack of lies, designed to either 1. Annoy people, (as per your stated goal, to lessen the enjoyment of playing RoM), or 2. To make it seem as if HOGG is actually playing by the rules, and not just going around griefing people.

This is further reinforced by the fact that there was a ton of people in Weeping Coast last night, contrary to your lie stating otherwise.

Very rarely do I check MMORPG.com forums.

Even more rarer, do I post.

I just have to say the the original poster of this topic, as well as MookieBookie or w/e, are indeed members of "HOGG", no matter how much they'd love to deny it, over and over and over.

Anyways, I say this because I've read these guys posts on the actual RoM forum, and it is quite funny.

Might as well give a tad bit of my opinion, although I'll probably never check this thread again - Grieving is an act of PKing someone over and over so much that it is considered harassment. Griefed is a word these people stuck into noobs heads.

On top of it, I have watched a few of these guys videos, and they do make me LoL sometimes. Especially at the fact that 90% of the kills are from people half their level or lower :)

Anyways, carebears and noobs fail to see the psychology, and for that matter, reverse psychology, these people push onto people before and after killing them.

There is a literal medical disease for this. I am not going to put effort into looking it up, but I thought that they should know that seeking joy out of other people's suffering is an actual legitimate medical disease, somewhere along the lines of insane.

You see, these people are, in a way, like Adolf Hitler. Quite smart, but they use their smarts in a bad way. I know a few people like this, usually I end up blocking them from any contact I have, and then just ignore them and their actions towards me or anyone. I knew this guy who, after arguing with a kid for a bit, convinced him he was adopted. Funny, right? Kinda. Stupid kid... and smart dude.

I'ma put my money on it that these guys are 20-30+ years old. Bored, little to no life, and nothing to do with their smart little selves besides make others, or try to at least, suffer.

I really don't care. I don't play the PvP server for one reason, and that would be that I think attacking in towns isn't PvP, it's madness ;P

In the end these people are unappealing, undesired, geeky, and outcasts to society. That is why they had to make their own little 'society' and give themselves something to do when they get home from... um... yea give themselves something to do. I feel kind of bad for them, because they really have nothing better to do then PK noobs all day long, and then show off about it, and try and come here, to get people in an uproar, trying to not show themselves as HOGGs. Be proud damnit, you seem so proud on your site, why not show it here? Show off your pig pride.

Good day.

I'm cracking up about the entire post. PVP servers are known for people who get their rocks off griefing others and ruining other players' experiences. If it's a free for all then people will take advantage of the ruleset, or lack thereof. HOGG appears to be a group of undesirables who think their manhood/womanhood is based upon PKs in a video game. Sort of like people who think they are gods at guitar and the workings of it and have never stepped foot away from their guitar hero games of matching colors on a screen. How hard is it to really just teleport somewhere else, recall, or go back to your own house? Or is all that different on a PVP server in ROM? Don't give them more pretend "power" by filling their heads with ideas of their own success. HOGG can't be that large of a problem considering they are based in a free to play game...they wouldn't want to pay to play a game they'll just end up ruining for themselves...Drive enough people away and then you won't have anymore sprites to prey on...which in turn makes them extremely unsuccessful in their endeavors. Obviously they have no personal lives, spouses, children, or IQ aside from whatever it is they do, if they are willing to wait around for 6 hours just for one person to log back in...You can look at a pile of crap all day and pretend it's a dozen roses...when you smell it it's still the same old crap.

Basically the point I'm trying to get across...If you want to find the needle in a haystack....then burn the hay.

I'm sorry to hear your troubles mmoluva. I play on the grimdal server and i can definitely say that there is a population issue. I'm not sure if its because of the HOGG clan that you mention or not but i can sure see how you formed the correlation. I probably wont be playing this game much longer there are only a few dungeons left that i havent explored yet. Once i have accomplished exploration and conquering of these dungeons i wll probably quit the game because theres almost nobody left. I dont play with any guilds because the childish arguing between guilds always makes their members look so pathetic i just dont want to be a part of that. Thanks for the heads up, you will save many new players a lot of grief by letting them know not to join Grimdal =)

P.S. whoever that is in your avatar picture they are very cute. I'm black too =)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I play on Grimdal,

The reality is this, Hoggs don't touch the high level areas because everyone else will mow them down. They stick to the mid level area. In this game pking really means nothing, you get killed, you are back in the action 1 minute later.

NO point to hunt hoggs down for the above reasons. Most people just ignore them, if you die to them, you just rez yourself nad move on. They are not influential at all on the grimdal server.

Cryomatrix

I should try to check out other servers to see whawt it's like.

I've been powerleved in Ravenfell a lot and although I have never seen a HOGG there i see much zone chat about them being there. I would guess that they don't linger much in high level areas just because there's hardly anyone there. There are much more people in lower level areas. I think its because by the time everyone finishes their grind to 52 they realize this game is dead and there's really nothing to do at 52 anyway.

Also I wouldn't say that hogg has no influence on this server because I see people crying in chat every day about how they hate the server/are going to quit the game because of people like HOGG. I've never been "griefed" by hogg or killed by them for that matter so I can say this with a clear head. =)

Good points but im not good with metaphors like roses and haystacks. However I must say that although you would think its easy to get away from people like HOGG and dying doesnt mean anything, people take dying quite seriously. Especially when it's a higher level player. I have seen hgih level players die to HOGG get quite angry. I mean look at world chat, there were people QQ'ing in world chat for hours yesterday because of HOGG. Some people take games and dying way too seriously and as long as people who think they are good exist, HOGG will have plenty of people to grief... =)
