Lets analyze:<br><br>Success Is:<br>(1)We succeed when people get griefed enough to call their guildies.<br>So you succeed when someone asks their guild for reinforcements. Let's you and I wonder why someone has a guild on a PvP server, shall we? A group of players that play together... what could that be useful for? Could it be.. and this is a theory here... that people have guilds to try and fight the other people in this game that have already grouped up to fight together? Could they in fact be calling a guild to stop the guild that - and this point may take some time to grasp so read it again, I can wait - already called out its other members to kill the intended victim? Breath and take it in. Already, the people you are killing, by your definition, are raging successes at this game. Somehow they actually managed to be a success without killing a single person, just by you calling your guild to fight in their zone. Ok. So by definition one you succeed with slightly more work than the level 20 guy you just killed.<br><br>(2)We succeed when people get angry enough to follow us around in safe zones. Ok. So you attack people. They attack you back. You run and they don't remain stationary. What do you do when you attack a guy and he runs? I don't follow HOGG around a lot so you can fill that in like a MadLib but in your head. Do you in fact follow them when they run? So, any time anyone doesn't stand still they succeed. Hey, sure dude works for me. People that move to avoid death are raging beacons of success.<br><br>(3)We succeed when people cry out in OOC chat and ask where HOGG is. When people ask where you are - you become a winner? Somehow any inquiry into your location is now the criteria for victory? Do the people win if they guess the correct zone? I'm not sure how that works. Is it a guessing game? You exist and if you are lucky enough for anyone else on Earth to care you get a prize? Sure, why not.<br><br><br>(4)We succeed every time we get a /tell because of our actions. So if someone talks to you, and they happen to be talking to you about you, you are now the champion? Are their more criteria? What if they are trying to explain to you why you just died to them? Did you win the duel because they PM'd you with advice? Does that me every time you respond they are now the winner? Every time you talk to someone are you bestowing victory on them? Sexy. Wait a minute... is this some sort of trick to get us to talk to you in game? Dude, all you had to do was come correct. ASL?<br><br><br>(5)We succeed when people write an essay about how we suck and post it on the forums. To be honest I can't argue with that. One would have to suck a lot, a massive amount really, for another person to take the time out of their life to post an essay about it on a gaming forum. That kind of sucking is probably worthy of some sort of prize. You win. You suck enough for people to write about it.<br><br>Sorry I don't have any sort of cool ribbon or trophy or anything. I was so cynical I didn't actually think you'd win this one - caught me by surprise here are the end. Crap.

But Clan also pwn HOGG: <br>HOGG that just want to grief on everything. Omni may think they can deal with HOGG<br>their way. But the only thing that can pwn a HOGG is a Clam, with some dsharks. The problem with Clan is: they pwn too much or pwn when it isn't appropriate - and it takes an Omni to show them that. But sometimes, Omni can be so full of grief that they become HOGG themselves... because Omni are an inch and half away from HOGG. I don't know much about this crazy, crazy world, but I do know this: If you don't let us pwn these HOGGs, we're going to have our Clan and Omni all covered in grief!<br><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180822202048/http://forums.anarchy-online.com/showthread.php?t=537421&amp;page=3">http://forums.anarchy-online.com/showth ... 421&amp;page=3</a><br><br>Tonight I had the pleasure of meeting two of HOGGs guildies, Zerghogg and some other hogg and they were so friendly I am a level 44 guardian and they are level 80 whatevers.

<div><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">I logged into Grimdal for the first time in 30 days since leaving for Indigo to see how much damage HOGG has done and it is as bad as I thougth it would be. I started in Logar from my house and right away I saw Thorzanhogg killing everyone zoning in and out of his house. By the time I got to Silverspring all I saw was HOGG this and that with Beasthogg killing everyone. People were forming search parties to kill them just as it was in the last two games I was in with them. The only way to get HOGG to stop is to stop logging in and a lot have already done that. These guys are insane at what they do and Im glad I saw blah blah was just Griefed by HOGG and left to Indigo when I did</span></div>

<div><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Excuse the ignorance...but what is this <span class="highlight"><strong>HOGG</strong></span> business?<br><br>Just another random well geared PKer griefing or what?They are a group of people who went out and spent dough on gearing up their characters from the cash shop, and now they like to go into low-level areas and grief the low-level players constantly.<br><br>I think that they are griefing under RoM's definition of griefing, and that they are spamming chat, and should be warned to stop. (At the very least the spamming chat everytime they kill someone.)<br><br>For the lower-level players, this is turning into a serious problem, as it is greatly annoying for the only high-level players in a low-level area to be killing lowbies. Gives a bad impression of higher-level characters, people think, well if this is the only thing to do once I reach 35+, then why should I keep playing? <br><br>I really wish the GMs would do something about these obvious griefers. I think one of them got banned for selling stuff for real money, but following people around and constantly killing them, without entering a war, is clearly griefing under the rules and should be dealt with accordingly. Spamming chat with announcements about killing people is exceptionally annoying, and is also against the rules. (It gets really bad if you have 4 or 5 of them traveling together, because then all 5 of them have to say who they killed.)<br><br>@OP: You do realize, that despite your smug satisfaction at having avoided them, that 1. They really aren't a threat to high-level players, 2. They will eventually move to Indigo as well? and 3. No one in the higher-level guilds takes them as a serious threat? They fail so bad at actual skills, that the only way they can kill people is if they are 5-10 levels below them, or if they outnumber them 3 to 1.</span></div>

<div><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">So we won't be seeing grimdal's favorite griefer guild (HOGG) for a couple days (according to their website) and it made me think about a few things. Does RoM frown upon PvP on grimdal? It seems like RoM is starting to hurt population-wise. I've noticed a big drop in population since i started but only now after so many weeks RoM takes action against said guild? Why not sooner? All hogg was doing was PvPing, and it makes me reluctant to continue leveling if I could punished simply for killing other players. A lot of people get spammed in /say when they get "griefed" by these players but with blacklist option clearly renders this spam obsolete, which leads me to believe that serious PvP (which very few people actually do on this server) can be punishable. I mean seriously outside of a couple people I never see anyone attacking anyone else on this game. Is it because they already know that PvP is punishable? Is there something I dont know about pvp servers???? someone please tell me whats going on here</span></div>

<div><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">LOL yes its clear by now that HOGG was not punished for any kind of chat actions. People spam in zone chat every time they kill HOGG and do they ever get banned? No. I see people spamming stupid things like "duck duck goose xxxx is it!!" in chat a thousand times per day and do they get banned? No. I see people using the most vulgar terms ive ever seen in zone chat against HOGG, do they get banned? Nope. So what was the only other thing HOGG was doing besides chat spam? Raping the souls out of every single player between Logar and Obsidian stronghold. So which seems more believable, banned for easily-blacklistable chat or worldwide-soulrapage?</span></div>

<div><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">HOGG is systematically destroying a F2P game I can't believe how Insane this guild of 4-5 players is at Grief. Everything in zone chat is HOGG this and that and when they kill someone they post it in zone chat EVERY SINGLE TIME "Louie was just GRIEFED by HOGG". Its getting old Im moving to Indigo. Dont join Grimdal HOGG has destroyed it.</span></div>

<p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">These people are very sad individuals, who have little else to do with their lives except grief, and they claim to be doing it because everyone else leads a sad life for playing mmo games. They may eventually realise that life is for living and grow up. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">What's funny though is that they tried to grief in Darkfall online at release, and got absolutely obliterated, so they left with their tails wagging between there legs. Not wanting to endorse Darkfall, but the game proved that the Hogg guys can't really do anything outside generic point and click mmo's, because they aren't good skill based fps players. Whats funny is that before Darkfall came out they made loads of You Tube threads saying they would destroy the game and its server in 2 months after launch, but they just got pawned every time they tried to grief, so hence they have moved back to easy games which they know they can exploit, e.g. point &amp; click theme park mmo's. Not having a pop at point &amp; click theme park, as I play them as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">My advice, just ignore Hogg if you get griefed, log out or escape, they can only be in one place at one time. Yes they claim they will wait 6 hours for you to log back in, but again people can only wait for so long before they get bored. Make another character and come back a day later, I doubt they'll be their despite what they claim. They are poor players who hunt in packs on individual low lvlers to get their kicks, nothing more. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Personally I have never encountered them, but I witnessed what happened to them in Darkfall.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Hogg sucked on Tyranny, they resorted to camping field of the dead lowbies with their max level chars and when 80's would show up they would die and disappear. The do fill a purpose in the MMO genre though. Everyone needs a bad guy. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180822202048/http://www.mmorpg.com/discussion2.cfm/thread/250810/HOGG-is-destroying-my-server-Grimdal.html">http://www.mmorpg.com/discussion2.cfm/thread/250810/HOGG-is-destroying-my-server-Grimdal.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;"><strong>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">HOGG never played Darkfall man if they had it would have been bad. They made fun of anyone that bought and played Darkfall you should listen to their HOGG Radio about it. You said you never witnessed them in action and I believe that because its something rediculous to see. I also played on Tyranny and it was really bad which their fraps shows. I watched them kill all kinds of great guilds on AOC and now ROM its really bad man. People always start off saying how they cant kill anyone their levels etc and they kill everyone.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">A guild that has a stated goal that is directly contrary to the rules should be banned on sight. HOGG's stated goal is to annoy other players, and they direct all their efforts to this end, clearly against the rules. Even though Grimdal is a PvP server, it does not give HOGG the license to go around and kill the same people over and over again. I personally think that taking your level 50+ toon into Logar and Silverspring and killing anyone there, when there is no benefit at all to your character, is just being an ass, and should also be considered griefing.<br><br>All that said, HOGG was not banned for PvPing, they were banned for PvPing and being a bunch of asses about it. Their stated goal on their site is to go into a game and grief everyone until they are banned. The fact that the RoM devs finally wised up to it is not a sign that the server is dying, it is a sign that the GMs are finally paying attention to the tons of reports about HOGGs being a-holes and racists.<br><br>Every-time they killed someone, regardless if it was 5 of them in the same area who all killed the same person, all 5 of them felt the need to tell the zone that they had just griefed someone. This is obvious spamming, especially when they are in a lower-level area, and no one has a chance against them. So all you see is **** was just griefed by HOGG. This is known as spamming zone chat, and thank god that rule was finally enforced.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">On the Grimdal server, the only thing that hogg means to us is a small group of players that do nothing but PK. They are in a guild called Hogg and have names like blablahogg. Generally they are PKing lower level people. I have heard stories that several of them were temporarily banned on our server. Not really sure, I saw one yesterday in Harf Tradding post in the door way at the house NPC attacking any lvl 30 that ran by. Than when he got attacked he ran inside his house.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Grimdal has been falling on it's own sword for months. Fact is more players have left and are leaving from unresolved pvp issues and changes that have been made as opposed to recent changes and the actions of just a couple people here recently. I don't really care to see HOGG get banned for doing what has been allowed. Just as I didn't care for the bannings in August for actions that were after the fact deemed punishable. Bold and improper moves in my opinion that have left the server feeling more hurt than helped as it has vastly affected the ingame economy as everyone of these players were big CS users.</span></p>

<p>Thorzan repeatedly referred to people as N----r. After many people having sent in various screenshots, most of us that were offended by it, just put him on the blacklist. So it would be more accurate to say that Thorzan used racist language, so far as I know, no other HOGG did.</p>

<p>Yes, of course, because I put my character's hp in my signature, I obviously must be dumb. Logic fail, but then, it doesn't surprise me that a HOGG doesn't know how to use logic.<br><br>Whenever I ask for a FA run, I am invited within 10 seconds to a party, (on my alt, who is only level 24). You're a HOGG, so you don't do FA, thus your opinion regarding it is moot. If you ever asked for a party, no one would want you, because your entire clan is a bunch of griefers.<br><br>To be honest, since you are a HOGG, I really don't give a crap what you think, because a lot of what comes out your mouth is just a pack of lies, designed to either 1. Annoy people, (as per your stated goal, to lessen the enjoyment of playing RoM), or 2. To make it seem as if HOGG is actually playing by the rules, and not just going around griefing people.<br><br>This is further reinforced by the fact that there was a ton of people in Weeping Coast last night, contrary to your lie stating otherwise.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very rarely do I check MMORPG.com forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more rarer, do I post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just have to say the the original poster of this topic, as well as MookieBookie or w/e, are indeed members of "HOGG", no matter how much they'd love to deny it, over and over and over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, I say this because I've read these guys posts on the actual RoM forum, and it is quite funny.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Might as well give a tad bit of my opinion, although I'll probably never check this thread again - Grieving is an act of PKing someone over and over so much that it is considered harassment. Griefed is a word these people stuck into noobs heads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On top of it, I have watched a few of these guys videos, and they do make me LoL sometimes. Especially at the fact that 90% of the kills are from people half their level or lower :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, carebears and noobs fail to see the psychology, and for that matter, reverse psychology, these people push onto people before and after killing them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a literal medical disease for this. I am not going to put effort into looking it up, but I thought that they should know that seeking joy out of other people's suffering is an actual legitimate medical disease, somewhere along the lines of insane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You see, these people are, in a way, like Adolf Hitler. Quite smart, but they use their smarts in a bad way. I know a few people like this, usually I end up blocking them from any contact I have, and then just ignore them and their actions towards me or anyone. I knew this guy who, after arguing with a kid for a bit, convinced him he was adopted. Funny, right? Kinda. Stupid kid... and smart dude.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'ma put my money on it that these guys are 20-30+ years old. Bored, little to no life, and nothing to do with their smart little selves besides make others, or try to at least, suffer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really don't care. I don't play the PvP server for one reason, and that would be that I think attacking in towns isn't PvP, it's madness ;P</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end these people are unappealing, undesired, geeky, and outcasts to society. That is why they had to make their own little 'society' and give themselves something to do when they get home from... um... yea give themselves something to do. I feel kind of bad for them, because they really have nothing better to do then PK noobs all day long, and then show off about it, and try and come here, to get people in an uproar, trying to not show themselves as HOGGs. Be proud damnit, you seem so proud on your site, why not show it here? Show off your pig pride.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good day.</p>

<p>I'm cracking up about the entire post. PVP servers are known for people who get their rocks off griefing others and ruining other players' experiences. If it's a free for all then people will take advantage of the ruleset, or lack thereof. HOGG appears to be a group of undesirables who think their manhood/womanhood is based upon PKs in a video game. Sort of like people who think they are gods at guitar and the workings of it and have never stepped foot away from their guitar hero games of matching colors on a screen. How hard is it to really just teleport somewhere else, recall, or go back to your own house? Or is all that different on a PVP server in ROM? Don't give them more pretend "power" by filling their heads with ideas of their own success. HOGG can't be that large of a problem considering they are based in a free to play game...they wouldn't want to pay to play a game they'll just end up ruining for themselves...Drive enough people away and then you won't have anymore sprites to prey on...which in turn makes them extremely unsuccessful in their endeavors. Obviously they have no personal lives, spouses, children, or IQ aside from whatever it is they do, if they are willing to wait around for 6 hours just for one person to log back in...You can look at a pile of crap all day and pretend it's a dozen roses...when you smell it it's still the same old crap.</p>
<p>Basically the point I'm trying to get across...If you want to find the needle in a haystack....then burn the hay.</p>

<p>Very clever. Yep get everyone to leave the server then post about how it was HOGG. Sorry kid, this is the first ive heard of them.</p>

<p>I'm sorry to hear your troubles mmoluva. I play on the grimdal server and i can definitely say that there is a population issue. I'm not sure if its because of the HOGG clan that you mention or not but i can sure see how you formed the correlation. I probably wont be playing this game much longer there are only a few dungeons left that i havent explored yet. Once i have accomplished exploration and conquering of these dungeons i wll probably quit the game because theres almost nobody left. I dont play with any guilds because the childish arguing between guilds always makes their members look so pathetic i just dont want to be a part of that. Thanks for the heads up, you will save many new players a lot of grief by letting them know not to join Grimdal =)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. whoever that is in your avatar picture they are very cute. I'm black too =)</p>

<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>I play on Grimdal,</p>
<p>The reality is this, Hoggs don't touch the high level areas because everyone else will mow them down. They stick to the mid level area. In this game pking really means nothing, you get killed, you are back in the action 1 minute later.</p>
<p>NO point to hunt hoggs down for the above reasons. Most people just ignore them, if you die to them, you just rez yourself nad move on. They are not influential at all on the grimdal server.</p>
<p>Cryomatrix</p>
<p>I should try to check out other servers to see whawt it's like.</p>

<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>I am a listener to the HOGG Radio show which is the best in the world to me. Grimdal is dead and has been destroyed by HOGG but Indigo is going pretty well so far.</p>

<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>I've been powerleved in Ravenfell a lot and although I have never seen a HOGG there i see much zone chat about them being there. I would guess that they don't linger much in high level areas just because there's hardly anyone there. There are much more people in lower level areas. I think its because by the time everyone finishes their grind to 52 they realize this game is dead and there's really nothing to do at 52 anyway.</p>
<p>Also I wouldn't say that hogg has no influence on this server because I see people crying in chat every day about how they hate the server/are going to quit the game because of people like HOGG. I've never been "griefed" by hogg or killed by them for that matter so I can say this with a clear head. =)</p>

<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Good points but im not good with metaphors like roses and haystacks. However I must say that although you would think its easy to get away from people like HOGG and dying doesnt mean anything, people take dying quite seriously. Especially when it's a higher level player. I have seen hgih level players die to HOGG get quite angry. I mean look at world chat, there were people QQ'ing in world chat for hours yesterday because of HOGG. Some people take games and dying way too seriously and as long as people who think they are good exist, HOGG will have plenty of people to grief... =)</p>

<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Grimdal is dead because of HOGG and yes they are the best Grifer Guild I have ever seen. Log in to Grimdal and you will be forced to agree it is dead. Indigo is in decent shape I like it so far but I miss all the diamonds I bought wish they could transfer it to Indigo. Ill try and see what I can accomplish over the next few days and If I cant be competitive Ill just try out another game.</p>

<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Ive seen people try and Gruef them back for maybe 30 minutes and then they go and do other things. Nobody can Grief HOGG. The best thing to do is switch servers like I did and now that I think about it that Griefed me also. Can't win against these guys.</p>
